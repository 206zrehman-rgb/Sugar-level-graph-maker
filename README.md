This program aims for users with all types of diabetes to track their sugar level. The program uses mmol/L readings. Tkinter was used as the interface library due to its level of ease to program a simple UI. CSV file was used to store the data, using Pandas allowed for the data to be stored in a dataframe to be used in matplotlib, allowing for a graph to be created.
